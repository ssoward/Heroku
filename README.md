# Heroku GWT Example

This is a sample GWT application that is set up to run on Heroku. It's based on the [GWT Maven Archetype](http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/user-guide/archetype.html) and uses [webapp-runner](https://github.com/jsimone/webapp-runner) to launch the application in a lightweight Tomcat container.

You can clone and deploy it to Heroku as is, but I would recommend adding a whole bunch of your own awesome code to it first.
